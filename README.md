- D4: Pin connected to the push button.
- GND: Ground connection.

## Setup Steps üõ†Ô∏è

Follow these steps to set up the circuit:

### 1. Circuit Connection

Connect the components as follows:

- Connect LEDs (3.3V Red, Green, Blue, Yellow LEDs) to pins D1, D2, D3, and D5 on the ESP8266 board.
- Connect the push button to pin D4 on the ESP8266 board.
- Connect the negative (shorter) lead of each LED to the ground (GND) on the breadboard to complete the circuit.

For detailed connections and pinouts, refer to the component directories in the `components` folder.

## Connecting LEDs on Breadboard üçûüí°

To connect LEDs on a breadboard, follow these steps:

1. Insert the LEDs into the breadboard, ensuring the longer lead (positive) is on one side and the shorter lead (negative) is on the other side.
2. Connect the positive (longer) lead of each LED to a digital pin on the ESP8266 board (D1, D2, D3, D5).
3. Connect the negative (shorter) lead of each LED to the ground (GND) on the ESP8266 board.
